# Prediction using Supervised ML

Predicting student's score based on number of hours of study using Linear Regression

## Dataset Description

The dataset has two variables, target variable is scores and independent variable is Hours. 

There is no missing values and outliers in the dataset.

There is positive liner relation between number of hours of studies and precentage of marks scored and High correlation between the variables.

## Linear Regression Model

Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y) and one or more independent (y) variables, hence called as linear regression.

The linear regression model provides a sloped straight line representing the relationship between the variables.

Mathematically, we can represent a linear regression as:

y= a0+a1x+ ε

Here,
Y= Dependent Variable (Target Variable)
X= Independent Variable (predictor Variable)
a0= intercept of the line (Gives an additional degree of freedom)
a1 = Linear regression coefficient (scale factor to each input value).
ε = random error

## Model evaluation

The model shows MAE(Mean Absolute Error) of 4.183859899002982
